    "## How to do FFT on an image?\n",
    "\n",
    "The recipe for calculating the Fourier transform of an image is quite simple: **take the one-dimensional FFT of each of the rows, followed by the one-dimensional FFT of each of the columns**. Specifically, start by taking the FFT of the N pixel values in row 0 of the real array. The real part of the FFT's output is placed back into row 0 of the real array, while the imaginary part of the FFT's output is placed into row 0 of the imaginary array. After repeating this procedure on rows 1 through N-1, both the real and imaginary arrays contain an intermediate image. Next, the procedure is repeated on each of the columns of the intermediate data. Take the N pixel values from column 0 of the real array, and the N pixel values from column 0 of the imaginary array, and calculate the FFT. The real part of the FFT's output is placed back into column 0 of the real array, while the imaginary part of the FFT's output is placed back into column 0 of the imaginary array. After this is repeated on columns 1 through N-1, both arrays have been overwritten with the image's frequency spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the vertical and horizontal directions are equivalent in an image, this algorithm can also be carried out by transforming the columns first and then transforming the rows. Regardless of the order used, the result is the same. From the way that the FFT keeps track of the data, the amplitudes of the low frequency components end up being at the corners of the two-dimensional spectrum, while the high frequencies are at the center. The inverse Fourier transform of an image is calculated by taking the inverse FFT of each row, followed by the inverse FFT of each column (or vice versa).\n",

    "Unfortunately, the arrangement of the 2D Fourier transform places the **low frequency components at the corners** of the transform. A spatial transform is easier to visualize if the DC component is in the center with frequency increasing towards the edge of the image. This can be arranged either by rotating each of the four quadrants in the Fourier transform by 180$^\\circ$, or by reordering the original image to give a transform which shifts or translates the transform to the center. This is done using **fftshift**. This is aimed to improve visualization and does not change any of the frequency domain information; changes only the way it is displayed. In face recognition, low frequency coefficients have the most important information which decrease as we move away from center of the translated Fourier spectrum of face image.\n",
